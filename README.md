<h1 align="center">Ticketmaster by City</h1>





<p align="center"> This project is a web application that allows users to search for events based on city and category using the Ticketmaster API. The application has two modules:

Search module: This module allows users to search for events by city and category. Users can enter a city name and select a category from a dropdown menu. The application then fetches events from the Ticketmaster API and displays them in a results container. Users can click on an event to view its details. The module also saves the user's search results to local storage.

Event module: This module displays the details of a selected event. It fetches the event details from the Ticketmaster API based on the event ID passed as a parameter in the URL. The module then displays the event name, date, time, venue, performers, and ticket availability. It also displays an image of the event and an image of the performer (if available).

The project is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and utilizes the Fetch API for data retrieval. It is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.
