<h1 align="center">Ticketmaster by City</h1>





<p align="center"> This project is a web application that allows users to search for events based on city and category using the Ticketmaster API. 

The code provided consists of two JavaScript functions, "Search" and "Event", that utilize the Ticketmaster API to search for events and display event details respectively. The "Search" function takes user input for city and category to query the API for relevant events and displays the results on the webpage. The "Event" function retrieves the event details for a specific event using the event ID parameter from the URL and displays the details on the webpage.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
The MVP for this project would be a functioning website that allows users to search for events by city and category and display the results on the webpage. Users should also be able to click on an event to view the event details on a separate page.
